# MongoDB as Alternative to Redis

## Why MongoDB Could Work Better

MongoDB can replace Redis for your use cases:

### Current Redis Usage in ERP:
1. **Session Storage** - MongoDB can handle this well
2. **Rate Limiting** - Can use MongoDB with TTL indexes
3. **Event Queue** - MongoDB Change Streams can replace Redis pub/sub
4. **Caching** - MongoDB's in-memory storage engine works great

### Advantages of MongoDB:
- ✅ Better Railway support (MongoDB Atlas integration)
- ✅ Persistent storage (unlike Redis)
- ✅ Can store complex data structures
- ✅ Built-in TTL for session expiration
- ✅ Change streams for real-time events

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add MongoDB to Your Stack

In Railway, you can:
- Use Railway's MongoDB plugin
- OR connect to MongoDB Atlas (free tier available)

### 2. Update Services to Use MongoDB

I can modify the services to use MongoDB instead of Redis:

```javascript
// Instead of Redis for sessions
const sessions = db.collection('sessions');
await sessions.createIndex({ expiresAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 });

// Instead of Redis for rate limiting  
const rateLimits = db.collection('rateLimits');
await rateLimits.createIndex({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 60 });

// Instead of Redis pub/sub
const changeStream = db.watch();
changeStream.on('change', (change) => {
  // Handle events
});
```

### 3. Benefits for Your ERP

- **Single Database**: Use MongoDB for both main data and caching
- **Better Integration**: MongoDB works seamlessly with Railway
- **Cost Effective**: One database instead of PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Simpler Architecture**: Less services to manage

## Quick Decision Guide

**Stick with Redis if:**
- You need ultra-low latency (< 1ms)
- You have very high transaction rates (> 10k/sec)
- You prefer separate concerns (cache vs database)

**Switch to MongoDB if:**
- You want simpler architecture ✓
- You need persistent caching ✓
- You want better Railway integration ✓
- You're having Redis connection issues ✓

## Next Steps

If you want to switch to MongoDB, I can:
1. Update all services to use MongoDB instead of Redis
2. Create MongoDB schemas for sessions, rate limiting, and events
3. Ensure graceful migration

Would you like me to implement MongoDB as the caching/session solution?
