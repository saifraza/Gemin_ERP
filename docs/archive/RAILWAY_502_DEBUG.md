# Railway 502 Error Debugging Guide

## Current Situation
- Services are running internally ✅
- Health checks pass inside containers ✅
- Railway proxy returns 502 ❌

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. Check Service Status in Railway Dashboard

Go to each service and check:
- **Deployment Status** - Should show "Active" 
- **Health Check Status** - Should show "Healthy"
- **Logs** - Look for any errors after startup

### 2. Verify PORT Configuration

In Railway, check each service's environment variables:
- PORT should NOT be manually set
- Railway sets it automatically
- Services read it from process.env.PORT

### 3. Check Railway's Health Check Configuration

In railway.json:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 30
  }
}
```

### 4. Common Issues

#### Issue: "Application failed to respond"
**Cause**: Railway's proxy can't reach the service
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure service binds to 0.0.0.0 (we did this ✅)
2. Check if service crashed after startup
3. Verify PORT is being used correctly

#### Issue: Health check timing out
**Cause**: Service takes too long to respond
**Solutions**:
1. Increase healthcheckTimeout in railway.json
2. Simplify health check endpoint
3. Remove database/Redis checks from health endpoint

### 5. Quick Fixes to Try

#### Option 1: Remove Health Check (Temporary)
Remove from railway.json:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start"
    // Remove healthcheckPath temporarily
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Add Logging
Add to your service startup:
```javascript
console.log('PORT from env:', process.env.PORT);
console.log('Actually listening on:', port);
```

#### Option 3: Use Different Health Check
Try a simpler endpoint that just returns 200:
```javascript
app.get('/', (c) => c.text('OK'));
```

### 6. What to Check in Railway Logs

Look for:
1. **Port binding confirmation**
   - "Server running on http://0.0.0.0:3000"
   
2. **Environment variables**
   - PORT should be a number (usually 3000-8000)
   
3. **Crash messages**
   - Any errors after startup
   - Memory issues
   - Unhandled rejections

### 7. Railway-Specific Checks

1. **Service is not paused**
2. **Deployment is successful** (green checkmark)
3. **No resource limits hit** (check metrics)
4. **Region matches** (all services in same region)

## Next Steps

1. Check Railway dashboard for service status
2. Look at full deployment logs
3. Try removing health check temporarily
4. Add more logging around PORT usage
5. Share any error messages from logs
