# Railway Connection Issue - SOLVED!

## The Problem
Your services are failing because:
1. Railway provides internal URLs like `redis.railway.internal`
2. These URLs only work **inside Railway's network**
3. Your local tests show the error: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND redis.railway.internal`

## The Solution

### Environment Variable Setup in Railway

For your services, you have two Redis URLs:
- **Internal** (for service-to-service): `redis://default:AUajrBfdAnIfJmLbSbVrtUVyvbHdwlDP@redis.railway.internal:6379`
- **Public** (for external access): `redis://default:AUajrBfdAnIfJmLbSbVrtUVyvbHdwlDP@ballast.proxy.rlwy.net:35503`

### What's Happening
When you set `REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` in Railway, it automatically uses the **internal** URL, which is correct for production but causes the DNS error you're seeing.

### Quick Fix Options

#### Option 1: Ensure Services Start Despite Connection Issues
Your latest code changes (lazy Redis connection) should help with this. The services should:
1. Start without Redis being immediately available
2. Try to connect in the background
3. Return degraded health status until connected

#### Option 2: Add Connection Retry Logic
The services need better retry logic for initial connection failures.

#### Option 3: Test with Public URLs First
For debugging, you could temporarily use the public URLs:
- Redis: `redis://default:AUajrBfdAnIfJmLbSbVrtUVyvbHdwlDP@ballast.proxy.rlwy.net:35503`
- PostgreSQL: `postgresql://postgres:RgnfOBTspYXhkAMkZmiQZiMoFALDBWEO@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:38625/railway`

## Immediate Action

The services should now start with the lazy connection changes. Check Railway logs for:
1. "Core API running on http://0.0.0.0:PORT"
2. "Redis connection attempt" messages
3. The health endpoint should work even if Redis isn't connected

## Verification

After deployment, test:
```bash
# Should return a response even if Redis isn't fully connected
curl https://core-api-production-76b9.up.railway.app/health
```

The response should show:
- `status`: "healthy" or "degraded"
- `cache`: "connecting" or "connected"
- `environment`: Shows if REDIS_URL is set
