## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Module:

1. **Database Schema**
   - Design tables in Prisma schema
   - Create migrations
   - Implement seed data

2. **API Endpoints**
   - RESTful endpoints in Core API
   - Service layer for business logic
   - Validation and error handling

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Module pages following UI patterns
   - Reusable components
   - State management
   - API integration

4. **AI Integration**
   - MCP tools for module-specific AI features
   - Natural language queries
   - Predictive analytics
   - Automation suggestions

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for API
   - Component tests for UI
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests for critical flows

## Success Metrics

### Per Module:
- [ ] All CRUD operations functional
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] UI matches design system
- [ ] Performance < 200ms response time
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] AI features integrated
- [ ] User documentation complete

### Overall:
- [ ] Seamless navigation between modules
- [ ] Consistent user experience
- [ ] Data integrity across modules
- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Accessibility compliant

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team:
- 2-3 Full-stack developers
- 1 UI/UX designer
- 1 Database architect
- 1 QA engineer
- 1 DevOps engineer

### Infrastructure:
- Railway deployment setup
- PostgreSQL database
- Monitoring tools
- CI/CD pipeline
- Backup strategy

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined module boundaries
2. **Integration Issues**: Test inter-module communication early
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize from the start
4. **Data Migration**: Plan for existing data import
5. **User Training**: Create documentation alongside development

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Start with General Ledger module
   - Set up module-specific database tables
   - Create base UI components for Financial modules
   - Implement first API endpoints

2. **This Week**:
   - Complete Chart of Accounts functionality
   - Implement Journal Entry processing
   - Create Financial Period management
   - Test GL module integration

3. **Ongoing**:
   - Weekly progress reviews
   - Continuous integration testing
   - User feedback incorporation
   - Performance monitoring

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing a comprehensive ERP system. By following this phased approach, we ensure:
- Logical progression from core to advanced features
- Minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Continuous value delivery
- Maintainable and scalable architecture

The total estimated timeline is 6-8 months for full implementation, with usable modules available from Phase 2 onwards.
